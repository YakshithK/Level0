Here are some great prompts to test your AI game generation system:

## **Simple Platformers**
1. A simple lava platformer with jumping and spikes
2. An ice world with double jump and sliding enemies
3. A forest platformer with floating platforms and slime enemies

## **Advanced Mechanics**
4. A space shooter with moving platforms and shooting enemies
5. A desert platformer with wall jumping and patrol enemies
6. An underwater game with grappling hooks and boss battles

## **Specific Themes**
7. A lava world with dash ability and breakable platforms
8. An ice castle with double jump and survival goal
9. A space station with shooting ability and collectible items

## **Complex Scenarios**
10. A challenging platformer with multiple abilities: jump, dash, and wall jump
11. A boss battle arena with lava theme and time-based goal
12. A survival game in space with moving platforms and shooter enemies

## **Edge Cases to Test**
13. A simple game with just jumping
14. A complex game with all abilities and all enemy types
15. A peaceful forest game with no enemies, just platforming

## **Expected Results:**
- **Simple prompts** should generate basic schemas with 1-2 abilities and 1-2 enemy types
- **Complex prompts** should generate schemas with multiple abilities and varied enemies
- **Theme-specific prompts** should match the theme with appropriate colors and effects

## **What to Look For:**
1. **Schema Generation**: Check if the JSON schema appears correctly
2. **Code Generation**: Verify that Phaser code is generated from the schema
3. **Theme Matching**: Ensure the generated code uses appropriate colors for the theme
4. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid prompts to see error messages

Try these prompts in order from simple to complex to see how well the AI handles different levels of complexity!
